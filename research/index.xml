      <description>Double Diffusive Convection In order to run this, you can find the code at Github.
First, we have the so-called &amp;ldquo;fingering&amp;rdquo; regime of DDC, which you can run with this script   
Next, we have &amp;ldquo;overstable&amp;rdquo; DDC, which you can run with this script</description>

      <title>Guide to Getting Started </title>

      <description>Welcome to the Bates Fluid Dynamics Group! Most of our work involves solving partial differential equations by computer. Typically, this means running simulations on supercomputers, most often the Leavitt cluster here at Bates.
Using Linux  All of the group&amp;rsquo;s software runs on Linux. You need to be familiar with the command line, and it helps to know a bit of bash shell scripting. We use the git version control system.</description>

      <title>Using Leavitt</title>

      <description>Basics In order to log in to leavitt, you will need to use ssh to connect to leavitt.bates.edu. When you log in to leavitt via ssh, you will be on the &amp;ldquo;head node&amp;rdquo;. This node is identical to the other nodes. It has 28 cores and 128 GB of memory. This machine is for doing small analysis tasks and submitting jobs. DO NOT RUN DEDALUS ON THE HEAD NODE. Instead, use a job script to submit runs to the compute nodes.</description>

      <title>Research Overview</title>

      <description>Mission The Bates Fluid Dynamics Group studies fluid and plasma dynamics using theoretical and computational tools. We are interested in problems related to Earth&amp;rsquo;s ocean and atmosphere, the confinement of plasmas in future fusion power generators, the Sun&amp;rsquo;s magnetic field, and Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere. We take the physicist&amp;rsquo;s approach to these questions: how can we use simplified models of isolated processes to develop a robust, systematic understanding of the dynamics?
Much of the group&amp;rsquo;s efforts are focused on stability and control of shear flows, particularly as they apply to major environmental and clean energy problems: how can we better model the vertical transport of heat and pollutants in climate models?</description>
