      <title>Well, that&#39;s a relief</title>

      <description>We released the beta version of Dedalus version 3 just under a year ago, on 15 Feb 2022. In that time, we&amp;rsquo;ve made tremendous progress in performance, usability, and IO. One thing that&amp;rsquo;s always gratifying is when you port a script as closely as you can, by copying and pasting and modifying until it conforms to the new syntax and find this:
And for the one run I checked, Dedalus 3 is 2.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;or how six months in the lab can save you an hour in the library.
For the 2022-2023 year, I&amp;rsquo;m visiting the Brown Theoretical Physics Center, hosted by Brad Marston. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to chat with all of the great fluid dynamicists here and hopefully start some new lines of research.
In fact, that&amp;rsquo;s already happened. In my second week at Brown, who comes to visit? None other than Professor Alexander Morozov from the University of Edinburgh, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s foremost experts on elastic turbulence, and a keen user of Dedalus.</description>

      <description>First off, a hearty congratulations to Xiaole &amp;ldquo;Alex&amp;rdquo; Jiang (Bates &amp;lsquo;21) and Kirstin Koepnick (Bates &amp;lsquo;21) for successfully defending their Honors Theses! Alex&amp;rsquo;s work concerned non-linear wave generation in rapidly rotating convection while Kirstin began an investigation of the smallest topologically protected system in classical mechanics.
While we&amp;rsquo;re congratulating, a very belated congrats to Morgan Baxter (Bates &amp;lsquo;20), who defended the very first Honors Thesis to come out of the Bates Fluids Group.</description>

      <description>As we start the winter term, we welcome two new members to our ranks. First, Anthony Okonkwo (Bates &amp;lsquo;20) joins the group as a senior thesis student working on fluid-structure interaction and modelling Taylor&amp;rsquo;s swimming sheet using immersed boundary methods in Dedalus. Anthony is majoring in physics and engineering and is particularly interested in mechanical engineering. Second, Muhammad Abdullah (Bates &amp;lsquo;22) is joining the group as a research student. He&amp;rsquo;s just getting started on instability theory, with an eye on helping to design a Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke lab experiment.</description>

      <description>The snow is falling, the semester is winding down, and everyone&amp;rsquo;s looking forward to a break. It&amp;rsquo;s been a very busy year for the Bates Fluids group, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce that in the past few weeks, we&amp;rsquo;ve had three (!!) papers accepted, including one featuring group member Morgan Baxter (Bates &amp;lsquo;20). The vast range of topics these papers cover, from biofilm growth to the stability of rotating plasmas to the flexible numerical methods we work on, speaks to the extremely broad applicability of fluid dynamics!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to annouce that our two papers on spin-weighted spherical harmonics are finally published in the Journal of Computational Physics X. The first paper covers the mathematical formalism, while the second paper demonstrates its performance in a number of test problems, including a fully convective, rotating dynamo problem:
On the right is the radial velocity while the left shows magnetic field lines, visualized using Vapor.
The most significant part of this research, aside from the fact that we have sparse, efficient spectrally accurate spherical basis functions in Dedalus, is that by using spin-weighted spherical harmonics, one can implement equations on the sphere directly in vector form:</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the start of a new year, and we have several new members in the group. Welcome to senior thesis students Fahim Khan and Avi Brach-Neufeld, juniors Hannah Beams, Becca Minsley, and Alex Jiang! Morgan Baxter is returning from a successful summer project to start his senior thesis as well.
Fahim is going to be focusing on some interesting infrastructure, trying to figure out how to streamline the management of supercomputer simulations.</description>
